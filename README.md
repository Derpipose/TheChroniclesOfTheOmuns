### Welcome to the Chronicles of the Omuns Repository!
This repository is the brain child of Derpipose and her husband KrystalHydralisk
This contains the current character builder for the Omuns RPG system, as well as a few other tools to help with gameplay.
Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it for your own Omuns adventures!

### Current status: In Development and not ready for release yet
The character builder is still being worked on, and there are many features yet to be added. Stay tuned for updates!
Current dev timeline is that I hope to have a working version by the end of 2026, Christmas time to be exact,  for the player side. 
June 2027 for the Game Master, or Chronicler, side. 
Both will have local databases at first, with online databases to be added later.

### What is being worked on?
Currently, there's a project that details everything that is being worked on actively. Each component has been broken down and made
into small bite-sized tasks. Since this is itterative development, there may be some tasks that go through and touch up the work of 
previous tasks.
