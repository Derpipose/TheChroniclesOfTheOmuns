### Welcome to the Chronicles of the Omuns Repository!
This repository is the brain child of Derpipose and her husband KrystalHydralisk
This contains the current character builder for the Omuns RPG system, as well as a few other tools to help with gameplay.
Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it for your own Omuns adventures!

### Current status: In Development and not ready for release yet
The character builder is still being worked on, and there are many features yet to be added. Stay tuned for updates!
Current dev timeline is that I hope to have a working version by the end of 2025, christmas break for the player side. 
May 2026 for the Game Master, or Chronicler, side. 
Both will have local databases at first, with online databases to be added later.
